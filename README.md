# HealthCareStatistics

Files for my new course on healthcare statistics using Julia.  Work has just started.  Watch this space.

Download the Julia file appropriate for your operating system from https://www.julialang.org and install the downloaded file.  Note where Julia is installed.

Download Microsoft Visual Studio code from https://code.visualstudio.com/ (there are files for Windows 10 and macOS).  Install VSCode.

Click the Extensions icon in the left-hand pane of VSCode and search for Julia.  Install the extension.
